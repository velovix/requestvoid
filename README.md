# RequestVoid
An incredibly simple web server that waits for and prints a list of the requests it has received.

I made this so that I didn't have to use http://requestb.in/ any more, which is a great service, but it's very slow and running it locally is non-trivial.

## Use
Send requests to `http://localhost:8090/void` and point your browser at `http://localhost:8090/` to view requests.
